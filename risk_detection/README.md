# üíä MediTrack: AI-Powered Drug Inventory & Supply Chain Management

**MediTrack** is an intelligent, multi-faceted system designed to revolutionize pharmaceutical logistics by leveraging Artificial Intelligence. This project automates and optimizes critical aspects of the drug supply chain ‚Äî from demand forecasting to inventory risk management ‚Äî ensuring that essential medicines are available **when** and **where** they are needed most.

---

## üöÄ Core Features

MediTrack consists of specialized machine learning models, each addressing a vital aspect of pharmaceutical supply chain management:

---

### üìà 1. Demand Forecasting & Supply Chain Optimization

* **Goal:** Predict future pharmaceutical demand to prevent stockouts and reduce waste.
* **Algorithm:** Two-Part Model using an **XGBoost Regressor**.

  * Part 1: Predicts the probability of a shipment.
  * Part 2: Estimates the shipment size.
* **Key Features Used:**

  * Lag features
  * Rolling averages
  * Cyclic time-based variables (e.g., sine/cosine of month/week)

---

### üìâ 2. Inventory Risk Scoring & Stockout Prediction

* **Goal:** Classify each drug into **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** risk categories.
* **Algorithm:** **Random Forest Classifier** with **94% accuracy**, and **100% accuracy on high-risk items**.
* **Key Features Used:**

  * Demand volatility
  * Stock coverage (in weeks)
  * Forecast-to-stock ratio

---

### üïí 3. Expiry Prediction & Shelf-Life Monitoring

* **Goal:** Predict remaining shelf life of drug batches to minimize wastage.
* **Algorithm:** **XGBoost Regressor**
* **Key Features Used:**

  * Initial shelf life
  * Current age
  * Storage conditions (e.g., *Standard*, *Cold-Chain*)

---

### üì¶ 4. Medicine Pack Verification (Computer Vision)

* **Goal:** Automatically verify identity and integrity of drug packages via images.
* **Algorithm:** Pre-trained **CNN** (e.g., ResNet or EfficientNet)

  * **Multi-Class Classification:** Identify among 150 drug types
  * **Binary Classification:** Detect if package is *Damaged* or *Undamaged*

### üì• Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SohamAmberkar/risk_detection.git
cd risk_detection
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

**Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üìä How to Run the Models

Run each model in the following sequence:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Train the Demand Forecasting Model

Trains and saves the optimized `xgboost_classifier.joblib` and `xgboost_regressor.joblib`.

```bash
python advanced_model_trainer.py
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Inventory Data for Risk Scoring

Generates `drug_inventory_levels.csv` from raw shipment data.

```bash
python generate_inventory_data.py
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Train the Inventory Risk Model

Trains the risk classification model and saves `risk_classifier_model.joblib`.

```bash
python train_risk_model.py
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Generate the Risk Model Performance Report

Generates evaluation plots and a report for the trained model.

```bash
python generate_risk_report.py
```
